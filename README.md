## TODO

- [x] .py configs
- [ ] Verification
- [ ] Logging joins, leaves, role changes, deletes, bans, kicks
- [ ] Moderation commands (ban, warn etc)
- [ ] Meme commands (honestly the easiest part)
- [ ] .serr and .err
- [x] source command
- [ ] robocop command
- [ ] eval and sh might need to be removed
